//
//  PlayerViewModel.swift
//  BaseballStats
//
//  Drives PlayerProfileView. The bio block is already on the
//  PlayerSearchResult passed in — we only fetch current + career here.
//
//  Two-way handling: every player gets four parallel fetches (batting
//  current, batting career, pitching current, pitching career). Whichever
//  endpoints return data determines isBatter/isPitcher/isTwoWay. The
//  backend returns 404 for the wrong group, which APIClient maps to nil
//  rather than throwing — so a position player just naturally has both
//  pitching responses as nil.
